## Bucket creation with Service Account Connection
Make sure you create a service account and follow all the steps mentioned in chapter 9 to complete the connection with gcp using service account. Once that is done we simply need to put the keys which will be a json file downloaded while we create keys, in the same folder. Change the name of the file to keys.json and link it as a credential from the provider. After that use the resource to create a bucket.
